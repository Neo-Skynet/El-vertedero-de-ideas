<p>Now listen closely</p>
<p>Here's a little lesson in trickery</p>
<p>This is going down in history</p>
<p>If you wanna be a Villain Number One</p>
<p>You have to chase a superhero on the run</p>
<p>Just follow my moves, and sneak around</p>
<p>Be careful not to make a sound</p>
<p>(Shh)</p>
<p>(No, don't touch that!)</p>

<p>Go!</p>
<p>(Throw it on him, not me!)</p>
<p>(Ugh, let's try something else)</p>
<p>Now watch and learn, here's the deal</p>
<p>He'll slip and slide on this banana peel!</p>
<p>(Ha ha ha, gasp! what are you doing!?)</p>
